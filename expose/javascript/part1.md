Question 1: It will print 20. The result is 10+10 so 20
Question 2: It will print 20 as well because the code goes through the if statement as add is true.

Question 3: It prints 20 with 10 and 10 added together.
Question 4: It errors out because the let variable doesn't have the hoisting that var has. The result variable is not defined before the console log.

Question 5: It errors because const is a constant that cannot be changed after it is declared. result cannot be changed with the addition of num1 and num2
Question 6: It doesnt even reach this line as it errors from the line before.
